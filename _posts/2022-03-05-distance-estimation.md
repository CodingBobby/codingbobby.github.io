When it comes to fractal images, I'm either hooked by the fractal itself, or by the technique it is was computed with.
I know it's weird, because both topics deserve my attention, but somehow I can't appreciate both at the same time so that I can combine the best of both.
Real artists are better at this, I guess.

This is probably why you only find black and white images in my fractal and attractor galleries [here](/projects/chaotic-shapes).
To be fair, another reason might simply be that there is already plenty computer software which has way better rendering methods and produces a lot higher quality images than I could ever achive with my little Processing programs.
