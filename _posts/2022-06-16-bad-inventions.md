This is a list of inventions or products so bad, that I get angry everytime I use them.

### MS Excel (and equivalents)
Having a large grid as a playground may be the first idea to come up with when building a software for table editing.
But it only works as long as you don't need a second table.
Okay, technically you can still do it, but how you do it is done differently by every person.
Some put it right next to it, some leave a column as a separator, some start the next table below the first, some create a weird mess with many small tables scattered around, some didn't even understand the basics of a table and try to use it like Word.
To make the border of tables more visible you then put lines of various styles around it, colour in cells and change fonts.
As soon as you have to insert another row, or one row get larger, or you combine multiple lines and there is another table next to or below it, shit hits the fan.
Putting every new table into a new page also doesn't work out in the long run, because after a certain number, you can't read their names anymore and you have to click on a tiny arrow to scroll through the *horizontal* tab list.
What a great invention.
And I didn't even start to talk about Excel's "advanced" features.
So what's the purpose of this?

### Potato chip bags
Who had the idea to put chips into a bag?
A damn bag.
For loosely piled and very easily breakable potato chips.
A bag you only have to touch with your little finger and you hear the crushing sound of crumbling chips.
For logistic reasons, they have to be inflated with nitrogen to keep them fresh, but more importantly, to be able to stack them into a box without said crumbling.
Think about how much volume in the delivery trucks is occupied by gas and not by chips.
And not only that, it is downright ugly to grab into the bag and fish out the last few ones.
Your entire arm is covered in paprika powder and salt!
So what's the purpose of this?

### Triple power socket
I know, you always need more sockets.
There will never be enough in your room.
So why are walls not covered in them?
Like everey 50 cm a double socket would be great.
As if anybody would be happy to find only three sockets for an entire living room!
Or as if anybody would say things like "oh I'm so happy that these four meters of the wall have no sockets, it looks so clean!".
So, the obvious solutions are those triple socket power cables.
But why on earth do they *always* have one or more of the following problems?

- cable too short
- cable too long
- too few sockets
- too many sockets
- cable too stiff
- casing too large
- useless and bothering switch

So what's the purpose of this?

### Wireless charging
The charging interface between your phone and the docking piece needs to be in such near proximity, that the wire it connects to is also in such near proximity, that the charging process is no longer wireless.
You also have the problem of aligning the spools in your phone with the interface.
If you don't do it perfectly, charging is slower and much less efficient.
And if you have a magnetically aligning interface, it sticks so strongly to the phone, that it makes literally no difference in usability than if you would simply plug it in.
Plus you just made the charging process vastly inefficient.
So what's the purpose of this?
