message: "Thanks a lot for your comment.\r\n\r\nWhat you say is very true, there are not many high-tier composers left in the cinematic industry.\r\nBut the indie stuff... Oh dear, I have no idea who is out there waiting for me to listen! I've heard a lot of great tracks, indeed most of what I've heard in adventure-style video games is awesome -- and right now, I'm wondering how there could be so many undiscovered artists!\r\n\r\nI know the soundtracks from Nier: Automata (good stuff!) but not from the other games you mentioned, and I'll check them out.\r\nThank you for the recommendations and have a nice day,\r\n\r\nBob."
