message: "All good composers have fled to videogames. No one hires composers for movies, less than 100 people in existence do that full-time. And for other stuff like series or videogames, there is so much high-quality music in videogames, that videogame composers literally work for free.  You probably don't believe me, but anyway, check the soundtracks of these games (ofc not all songs are hype, but some should definitely fulfill what you say above)\r\n[]Nier (:Automata)\r\n[]Kingdom Hearts\r\n[]Atelier  \r\n\r\nSmash Bros Ultimate works as well I guess, since it is a compilation of so many videogames, but obviously a 24-hour soundtrack will not have as many good songs xaxaxa  \r\n\r\nAnyway, hope you find some good songs :)"
