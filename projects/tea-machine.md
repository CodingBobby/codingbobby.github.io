title: CodingBobby | Tea Machine
---
This is an idea of a brewing machine that lifts the teabag out after a set time.

I want it to be controlled with some kind of interface where the input is done either via buttons or a dial knob.
The visual output could be realised with a segment display or an array of LEDs.

Below is a first sketch of how I want to look like.
