Hey!

Awesome to see you here.

This website[^copyright]<sup>,</sup>[^style] started a few years ago as a weekend project when I felt the need to combine my main interests in some way.
Here I would like to share my thoughts with you and talk about things that otherwise have no place in my everyday life or are simply worth writing down.
Sometimes I have ideas that may sound a little silly but still deserve some attention.
Or I recently learned something amazing that I want more people to know about.

Regardless of whether you know me already from my old site or if you just found it, I hope you will enjoy browsing on my small web presence.

Take care, *Bob*.

I am a proud member of the orange team of the 512KB Club!

The internet has become a bloated mess because of massive JavaScript libraries, tons of popups, huge images and other media that requires years to request and download.
But we can make a difference -- all it takes is some optimisation.

I am also part of the [IndieWeb Webring](https://xn--sr8hvo.ws/directory) you can explore here:

This website was last compiled on {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} with Jekyll and üíö.

### Distributed Computing
I highly recommend you learn about [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu) if you haven't already.
It gives you the opportunity to join distributed computing networks of your choice and take part in real science research by donating some of your PC's power.

Especially in the current situation, I can only encourage you to join [Rosetta@home](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/) to contribute to research on the coronavirus.
Together we can provide science with computing capacities that surpass even the most powerful supercomputers.

Here, you can see in which projects I currently participate:

### Privacy Policy
This website does only use cookies when embedding third-party content like images or inline Spotify players [here](/blog/modern-musical-masterpieces).
I have no influence on them and they are required for the functionalities.
For visitor counting, I use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) which is very lightweight and does only collect the very essentials and not your personal data.
Elsewhere, this website does not use any other cookies or tracking techniques.
Though, it is making use of your browser's local storage to save the currently set theme.
This only takes a single key-value pair, so you shouldn't be bothered.
Have fun browsing on this minimalistic site.
