## Shapes of Chaos
Artistic renderings of mathematical structures, attractors in particular.
Get an overview of them [here](chaotic-shapes) and download them as wallpapers for your desktop.

## Traktify
A multi-platform desktop app that provides super easy super fast access to your [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) account.
It's currently in development and I'm collaborating with [Bumbleboss](https://bumbleboss.xyz).
Traktify's logo was a project on its own, you can find more about it [here](traktify-logo).
You can read more on the dedicated [website](/traktify) or check out the [repo](https://github.com/CodingBobby/traktify).

## codingbobby.xyz
The very website you are most likely browsing right now.
It is written in [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/), [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is then compiled with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) into a static website.
If you like to check out the repository, you can find it [here](https://github.com/CodingBobby/codingbobby.github.io).
