## Shapes of Chaos
Artistic renderings of mathematical structures, attractors in particular.
Get an overview of them [here](chaotic-shapes) and download them as wallpapers for your desktop.

## Traktify
A multi-platform desktop app that provides super easy super fast access to your [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv){:target="_blank"} account.
It's currently in development and I'm collaborating with [Bumbleboss](https://bumbleboss.xyz){:target="_blank"}.
Traktify's logo was a project on its own, you can find more about it [here](traktify-logo).
You can read more on the dedicated [website](/traktify){:target="_blank"} or check out the [repo](https://github.com/CodingBobby/traktify){:target="_blank"}.

## codingbobby.xyz
The very website you are most likely browsing right now.
It is written in [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/){:target="_blank"}, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){:target="_blank"} which is then compiled with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} into a static website.
If you like to check out the repository, you can find it [here](https://github.com/CodingBobby/codingbobby.github.io){:target="_blank"}.
